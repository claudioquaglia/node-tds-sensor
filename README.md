# Node TDS sensor

A simple Node.js module for read water TDS and EC, using compatible module

# Pre requisite

Since the Raspberry Pi board does not have a module for converting analog to digital signals, there is a need to purchase a dedicated module such as the [ADS1115](https://www.amazon.com/Converter-Programmable-Amplifier-Development-Raspberry/dp/B07TGB6KF8/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=ADS1115&qid=1589726665&sr=8-4) or an [MCP3008](https://www.amazon.com/Microchip-MCP3008-I-10-Bit-ADC-Pack/dp/B01HGCSGXM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=MCP3008&qid=1589726690&sr=8-1). So I assume that the connections with the board are already made according to the manufacturer's specifications.

# Installation

```bash
  $ npm install node-tds-sensor
```
